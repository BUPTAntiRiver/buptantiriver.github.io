First install vim, then open your terminal and run:

```bash
vimtutor
```

Finish the tutorial, great! Now you have enough knowledge to use vim well in IDE with extension. But I am sure that is not what you want, right? You want to be a PRO, who uses only text editors and gets rid of modern powerful IDE.

Then I think we should dive into buffers or maybe try lazy vim to bring more power.
