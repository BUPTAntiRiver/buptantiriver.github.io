A **PYI file** is a **Python Interface** file, commonly referred to as a _stub file_. It is a _plain text_ file that contains _type hints and function signatures_ for a corresponding Python module (a `.py` file), but it does not contain any executable code or implementation details. The "i" stands for "interface".

A `.pyi` file is typically placed in the same directory as its corresponding `.py` file, or within a designated `typeshed` repository or "typings" folder that type checkers are configured to use.
